Enable RabbitMQ application repository:

echo "deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian/ testing main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the verification key for the package:

curl http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc | sudo apt-key add -
Update the sources with our new addition from above:

apt-get update
And finally, download and install RabbitMQ:

sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
In order to manage the maximum amount of connections upon launch, open up and edit the following configuration file using nano:

sudo vim /etc/default/rabbitmq-server
Uncomment the limit line (i.e. remove #) before saving and exit using :wq
